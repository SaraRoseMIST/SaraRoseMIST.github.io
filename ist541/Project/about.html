      Hi, Iâ€™m Sara Rose, and welcome to *The Instructional Designersâ€™ Field Guide* project. This site is part of my graduate research at CSU Monterey Bay, exploring how to better support new and transitioning instructional designers. What youâ€™ll find here are early prototypes, multimedia experiments, and updates as the Field Guide takes shape. Think of this as the behindâ€‘theâ€‘scenes lab where theory meets practice.

	    <p>Welcome to the <em>Instructional Designers&rsquo; Field Guide</em>â€”a digital companion to the book created for early-career and transitioning instructional designers, learning technologists, and educators stepping into the world of design for learning.<strong> </strong>This site is designed to extend the book&rsquo;s mission: making instructional design practical, accessible, and visually intuitive. Here, you&rsquo;ll find interactive demos, visual walkthroughs, multimedia examples, and behind-the-scenes updates from the making of the Field Guide. What started as a thesis became a toolkit. What became a toolkit is now growing into a learning ecosystem. If you're new to the field, this guide is here to say: <em>You don&rsquo;t need to know everything, but you deserve tools that work.</em></p>

      This Field Guide began as a response to a common challenge I kept hearingâ€”new instructional designers often feel overwhelmed by theory and under-equipped for real-world tasks. My goal is to create something thatâ€™s both practical and encouraging. As the project evolves, Iâ€™ll be adding new examples, templates, and even voices from the field. This is just the beginning.
