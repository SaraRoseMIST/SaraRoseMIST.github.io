	<h2>How to Use The Field Guide</h2>
  <p><strong>The Instructional Designers’ Field Guide</strong> is designed to be a practical, non-linear resource that adapts to your workflow. Rather than a traditional textbook, it’s built as a modular toolkit - something you can dip into as challenges arise in your instructional design work. This page offers a preview of how the guide is intended to function, what design choices support that approach, and what tools and strategies will be included when the full version is released.</p>
